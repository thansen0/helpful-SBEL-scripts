# Helpful Scripts

These are some of the scripts I've written over time, and I decided to collect them into a similar repo to make sharing easier.

Running the python scripts to extract message topics will include installing the dependencies, then 

```
 $ python imu_to_csv.py -i /path/to/rosbag/folder -o /path/to/rosbag/folder
```

It will put the output in whatever directory you select (as given the same rosbag folder the data is stored in).
